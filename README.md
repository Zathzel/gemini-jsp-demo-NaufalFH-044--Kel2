## 📌 About This Project

This repository contains a simple **Spring Boot web application** that integrates **Google Gemini AI** using **manual REST API calls**.  
The frontend is built using **JSP**, and the backend follows the **Spring MVC** pattern.

This project was created as part of an academic assignment to explore:
- Spring AI concepts
- AI integration using REST API
- Server-side rendering with JSP
- Basic AI-assisted applications

The goal is not complexity, but **clarity and understanding**.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Hello World Page**  
  Basic page to confirm Spring MVC and JSP configuration.

- 🤖 **Gemini AI Chat Page**  
  Users can enter prompts and receive responses directly from Gemini AI.

- 🔗 **Manual REST API Integration**  
  No SDK or third-party AI library. All requests are sent via HTTP using `RestTemplate`.

- 🎨 **Simple & Clean UI**  
  JSP pages styled with embedded CSS for readability.

---

## 🧠 How the Application Works

1. User opens the chat page in the browser
2. A prompt is submitted via a form
3. Controller receives the request
4. Service layer sends a POST request to Gemini API
5. Gemini returns a response in JSON format
6. Response is parsed and rendered back to the JSP page
